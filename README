This extension to the YUI DataTable widget provides a context menu that enables column show/hiding.

Pass the config option showColumnChooser: true in your DataTable config object
and make sure ContextMenu is included in your page.

Right-clicking on the table header will show the context menu, listing all columns
in the table and with visible ones checked.  Clicking on a menu item will show/hide the column.


It's a bit like http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/datatable/dt_colshowhide.html
but built in by extending the DataTable
